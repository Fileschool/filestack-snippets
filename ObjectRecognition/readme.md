# Filestack AI Image Tagging Example

This repository demonstrates how to use the **Filestack API** to upload an image, resize it, and display AI-generated tags for objects in the image. This example uses Filestack's image tagging capabilities to analyze and identify objects within uploaded images.

---

## Features

- **Image Upload**: Upload images using the Filestack API.
- **Image Resizing**: Resize images for display using Filestack transformations.
- **AI Image Tagging**: Fetch and display tags with confidence scores for recognized objects.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: A clean and responsive layout with organized results.

---

## Prerequisites

To run this example, you will need:

1. A valid **Filestack API Key**.
2. A **policy** and **signature** for secure API calls.
   - These can be generated from your [Filestack Dashboard](https://www.filestack.com/).

---

## How to Run

### 1. **Clone the Repository**:
   
   `git clone <repository-url>`
   
   `cd <repository-folder>`
   
### 2. Edit API Key and Credentials

- Open the `index.html` file.
- Replace the placeholders `YOUR_API_KEY`, `YOUR_POLICY`, and `YOUR_SIGNATURE` with your Filestack credentials.

### 3. Serve the Application

Use a local web server to run the `index.html` file. For example:

#### Using Python's built-in HTTP server:

`python3 -m http.server`

#### Using Node.js http-server:

To serve the application using Node.js http-server, run the following command:

`npx http-server`

### 4. Access the Application

- Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8000` (or the appropriate local server address).

### How It Works

1. Click the **"Upload an Image"** button.
2. Select an image to upload.
3. The image will be resized to a smaller version for display.
4. Tags generated by the Filestack AI API will appear **next to the image** with their confidence scores.

### Code Overview

- **HTML**: Structure of the interface, including the upload button, image display, and tag list.
- **CSS**: Styling for a modern, responsive layout.
- **JavaScript**:
  - Handles image uploads using the Filestack API.
  - Fetches AI tags for the uploaded image.
  - Dynamically updates the DOM to display the results.

---

### Notes

- Ensure your Filestack **API Key**, **policy**, and **signature** are valid.
- The **resize transformation** reduces image dimensions for better display.
- For production, review security settings and ensure proper optimization.
