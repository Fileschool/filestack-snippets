# Image Upload and Tagging Example

This repository contains an example of an image upload and tagging application using Filestack's API. The example allows users to upload an image, display the uploaded image, and fetch its automatically generated tags.

## Features

- Upload images via the Filestack API.
- Display the uploaded image on the screen.
- Fetch and display AI-generated tags for the uploaded image.
- User-friendly interface with simple styling.

---

## Prerequisites

To run this example, you need the following:

- A Filestack API key.
- A security policy and signature (if required by your Filestack configuration).

---

## How to Run

### 1. Clone the Repository:

`git clone <repository-url>`
`cd <repository-folder>`

### 2. Edit API Key and Credentials:

- Open the `index.html` file.
- Replace the placeholders (`YOUR_API_KEY`, `YOUR_POLICY`, and `YOUR_SIGNATURE`) with your Filestack credentials.

---

### 3. Serve the Application:

Use a local web server to serve the HTML file. This is necessary to avoid CORS-related issues.

- **Using Python's built-in server:**
  
    `python3 -m http.server`
    

- **Using Node.js with http-server:**
    
    `npx http-server`
