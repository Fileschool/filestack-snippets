# Forms Recognition App

This repository contains a simple example of a **Forms Recognition App** using the Filestack JavaScript API and OCR functionality. This app allows users to upload scanned forms and extracts text from the uploaded forms using Filestack's OCR capabilities.

## Features

- Upload scanned forms using the Filestack File Picker.
- Extract text from the uploaded forms using Filestack's OCR API.
- Display extracted text directly in the browser.
- Modern and responsive user interface.

## Prerequisites

To run this app, you will need:

1. A Filestack API key.
2. A Filestack security policy and signature (if required by your Filestack configuration).

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repository

`git clone <repository-url>`

`cd <repository-folder>`

### 2. Edit API Key and Credentials

1. Open the `index.html` file.
2. Replace the placeholders `YOUR_API_KEY`, `YOUR_POLICY`, and `YOUR_SIGNATURE` with your Filestack credentials.

`javascript`

`const apikey = 'YOUR_API_KEY'; // Replace with your Filestack API key`

`const policy = 'YOUR_POLICY'; // Replace with your Filestack policy`

`const signature = 'YOUR_SIGNATURE'; // Replace with your Filestack signature`

### 3. Serve the Application

Use a local web server to serve the index.html file. This is necessary to avoid CORS-related issues when testing by opening it directly from the folder.

#### Using Python's Built-in HTTP Server:

`python3 -m http.server`

#### Using Node.js `http-server`:

`npx http-server`

### 4. Access the Application

Open your browser and navigate to [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000) (or the appropriate local server address).

### 5. Use the App

2. Select a scanned form to upload.
