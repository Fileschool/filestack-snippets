# 📸 Filestack Watermark Demo

This project demonstrates how to use the **Filestack JavaScript API** to upload a target image and a logo, then dynamically **apply a watermark** (logo overlay) to the image using Filestack's real-time transformation URL.

> 💡 No image editing software needed — all transformations happen in real time using Filestack’s CDN!

## 🔧 How It Works

1. **Upload Target Image**  
   A Filestack picker allows users to upload any image to be watermarked.

2. **Upload Logo Image**  
   A second picker uploads the logo that will act as the watermark.

3. **Apply Watermark**  
   When both uploads are complete, the logo is overlaid on the target image using the following transformation URL:
   `https://cdn.filestackcontent.com/watermark=file:your_logo_handle,size:250,position:[middle, center]/your_file_handle`

4. **Display Results**  
The original and watermarked images are displayed side by side.
